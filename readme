read this file for description of different sim files

sim1 - fixed energy, multiple bias, multiple primaries - ideal to test different params in a generic case

sim2 - fixed energy and bias layers, multiple primaries - for testing hits vs primaries or other params vs primaries - includes repetitions

sim3 - fixed energy, multiple bias and multiple primaries - for testing params vs primaries across different bias - includes repetitions
